          On a cloud night on the top of a hill of a suburben town lies a
          mansion built of bricks and wood. A shadow like figure creeps along
          the side of the mansion sneaking through the driveway to a window
          quickly opening it before carefully going inside hiding from praying
          eyes. Once inside the figure walks casually through the halls until
          they heard voices coming from the living room. Acting quickly the
          figure leaned their back against the wall keeping an eye on the
          situation in front of them, the light from the living room reviled the
          figures appearence, with their black hair covering their toned head
          while cold brown eyes stared to the unfolding scene with determination
          and greed as something caught their eyes as three people were arguing
          with each other about something that happened hours purier to now.
          <p>
          "Genevive when will you understand that this is good for the company"
          a old looking male with brown-black hair and blue eyes said as he
          tried to reason with a younger looking female with red hair and blue
          eyes.
        </p>
          <p>
            "No father when will you understand that I will not marry a complete stranger just for your company"
          </p>
          As the two kept argue back and forth while the older female with red hair 
          like the young women but with green eyes tried to stop them.
          The hiding male however, didn't care about their family issues all he cared about was a 
          priceless diamond nacklace around the neck of the young red head, 
          smirking to himself as he thought of the perfect plan to aquire the necklace to keep for himself just like all the other 
          priceless jewels he's aquired over the years as the miscivious 
          male is a famous theif, famous for stealing rare jewels for high class security systems keeping the treasures all to himself. 
          <p>
            The next day the famous theif put his plan into action carfully following the young red head to her room last night finding her schedule for the day. 
            Descising himself as a person who work in her father company, inside the company building as the theif saw the young red head enter the building to 
            help her father orginize a meeting going around the theif purposely bump into the red head startling her for a few seconds.  
          </p>    
          "I'm so sorry miss I didn't see you" he apolgized
          <p>
            "Oh its alright I didn't see you either"
          </p>
            "Are you lost miss?"
        </p>
            "No not at all, I'm Genevive by the way" she answered raising her hand slightlyto shake
            <p>
              "James, it nice to meet you" the theif returned shaking Genevive's hand using his 
              real name as he thought it wouldn't matter if he used his real name or not.
            </p>
            "Nice to meet you as well hopefully I will see you again"
            <p>
              "likewise" James said with a fake smile as he thought of how 
              easy this mission will go. However, what he didn't know was how wrong he was entirely.
            </p>
            As the days few by James and Genevive began to become closer as 
            James took the red hair women out for coffee or lunch. Soon the days turned to months and as planned
