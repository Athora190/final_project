          On a cloud night on the top of a hill of a suburben town lies a
          mansion built of bricks and wood. A shadow like figure creeps along
          the side of the mansion sneaking through the driveway to a window
          quickly opening it before carefully going inside hiding from praying
          eyes. Once inside the figure walks casually through the halls until
          they heard voices coming from the living room. Acting quickly the
          figure leaned their back against the wall keeping an eye on the
          situation in front of them, the light from the living room reviled the
          figures appearence, with their black hair covering their toned head
          while cold brown eyes stared to the unfolding scene with determination
          and greed as something caught their eyes as three people were arguing
          with each other about something that happened hours purier to now.
        </p>

        <p id="story">
          "Genevive when will you understand that this is good for the company"
          a old looking male with brown-black hair and blue eyes said as he
          tried to reason with a younger looking female with red hair and blue
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "No father when will you understand that I will not marry a complete
          stranger just for your company"
        </p>
        As the two kept argue back and forth while the older female with red
        hair like the young women but with green eyes tried to stop them. The
        hiding male however, didn't care about their family issues all he cared
        about was a priceless diamond nacklace around the neck of the young red
        head, smirking to himself as he thought of the perfect plan to aquire
        the necklace to keep for himself just like all the other priceless
        jewels he's aquired over the years as the miscivious male is a famous
        theif, famous for stealing rare jewels for high class security systems
        keeping the treasures all to himself.
        <p id="story">
          The next day the famous theif put his plan into action carfully
          following the young red head to her room last night finding her
          schedule for the day. Descising himself as a person who work in her
          father company, inside the company building as the theif saw the young
          red head enter the building to help her father orginize a meeting
          going around the theif purposely bump into the red head startling her
          for a few seconds.
        </p>
        "I'm so sorry miss I didn't see you" he apolgized
        <p id="story">
          "Oh its alright I didn't see you either"
        </p>
        "Are you lost miss?" "No not at all, I'm Genevive by the way" she
        answered raising her hand slightlyto shake
        <p id="story">
          "James, it nice to meet you" the theif returned shaking Genevive's
          hand using his real name as he thought it wouldn't matter if he used
          his real name or not.
        </p>
        "Nice to meet you as well hopefully I will see you again"
        <p id="story">
          "likewise" James said with a fake smile as he thought of how easy this
          mission will go. However, what he didn't know was how wrong he was
          entirely.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          As the days few by James and Genevive began to become closer as James
          took the red hair women out for coffee or lunch even going out
          together having fun. Soon the days turned to months and as planned
          James was able to gain Genevive's trust however, without realizing it
          he himself started to feel something for Genevive, as he alway looked
          forward to meeting her again.

        <div id="chapter 2">
          <h3 id="chapter">Chapter 2</h3>
          <p id="story">
            As the days flew by James soon began to realize something was wrong
            with himself for he had never felt this way for someone before, not
            for a long time. determined to push these feelings away James
            quickly began to initalize his original plan stealing the diamond
            necklace before disappearing into the night never to be seen again.
            like it always has been and always will be.
          </p>

          <p id="story">
            making up his mind James told Genevive a cover up story that he was
            being transferred out of state not knowing when he will be coming
            back, this left Genevive very upset and James know it. Even though
            his heart was aching James didn't let get to him as he hugged
            Geneviveone last time making sure to remember her scent of roses for
            the rest of his life.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            That night James snuck into the Lawson masion again this time to do
            what he originally intented to do, steal any priceless jewels the
            family owned starting with the diamond necklace in Genevive's room.
            Going the same route as before James climbed the side window this
            time everyone was asleep, or so he thought.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            As James opened the door Genevive's room he saw a light coming from
            the room bathroom suite acting quickly James opened Genevive's
            nightstand drawer finding what he had come for however, what he also
            found was a picture of her and himself when they went to the park
            after work, feeding the geese and feeling the sun on their skin.
            James smiled at the memory as his heart melted in bliss.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            Coming back to his senses James took both the necklace and the photo
            however, as he was about to leave through the window James dummped
            into something alerting the person in the bathroom of his presence.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "Hello, is someone there?" a female voice questioned
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            In a panic, James rushed to the window hoping to not get caught
            however, he was too late. Genevive stepped out of the bathroom in
            clear view of James as his silhouette could be seen in the
            moonlight.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "James? What are doing here?" she asked
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            Genevive's question was answered when she caught a glimse of her
            family hairloom in James' hands, her expression went from confusion
            at heartbrake in a second at the scene.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "Genevive, wait its not what it looks like" James said mostly to
            himself as climbed down the window walking towards her.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "Then what is it James!?" Genevive shouted as tears started to run
            down her cheeks
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            James was at a lose for words as he just looked down defeated, as he
            never wanted this to turn out like this. James started at the
            necklace in his hands as he could see his own small refection of
            himself before looking back at Genevive seeing how heartbroken she
            was made him realize the huge mistake he had done.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "Genevive, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for things to end up this
            way"
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "So you were just going to use me, make me fall in love with you.
            Then you were just going to leave just like that"
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "No, I" James began but stopped as he knew what Genevive said was
            true.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "I'm sorry, Genevive. You don't have to forgive me but please know
            that I never meant to hurt you" James took a hold of Genevive's
            hands giving the necklace back to her.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            Genevive jerk her hands away from his, looking at the necklace in
            her hands before throwing it back to him. Her eye now glared at
            James in rage and betrayal.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "Never meant to hurt me huh, you already have. And keep the stupid
            necklace, its what you came for isn't it? Now get out"
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            Following what Genevive said James left through the window with the
            face of defeat as he escaped into the night while Genevive cried
            herself to sleep as the one she thought she loved was only using her
            to get what they wanted just like her father.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            As the weeks went by Genevive and James never spoke to each other
            after the night. Genevive's father, Castro Lawson continued to push
            Genevive to marry the son of a business rival of his company to
            expand their product. Taking full advantage of Genevive's saddened
            state, feeling lost and heartbroken Castro's daugther finally agreed
            to the purposal and soon in a month Genevive will be married.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            The news of their wedding spread like wildfire in moments James also
            heard of this. In his home James held the Lawson diamond necklace in
            his hands as he made a decision that would change his life forever.
          </p>
          <p id="lastFewParagraphs">
            On the day
            <span id="story">
              of the wedding Genevive was walking down the aisle with her father
              on her right and mother on the left in a beautiful bright white
              dress that flowed to the ground following her as she walked.
              Genevive may look beautiful on the outside however, on the inside
              she was an emotionless broken women with nothing else to live for.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            As she made it to the end of the aisle next to a man with blond hair
            and sky blue eyes, he lifted her vial to revil her broken eyes that
            were displayed on her gorgeous face. Just as the priest began the
            ceremony a helicopter could be heard on the roof, everyone in the
            crowd was confused expectally the Castro as it wasn't supposed to
            arrive until the ceremony was over.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            a few moments later a thick black line of string appeared on the
            front window behind the priest. suddenly a man with black hair and
            cold brown eyes in a black tuxedo slid down to the center the string
            before swinging into the window breaking the glass, casually walking
            towards the bride as she stared at the intruder in shock unable to
            move.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "James" Genevive said softly as he came closer wiping the tears she
            didn't know she had.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            "What is the meaning of this!?" Castro yelled at the scene before
            him.
          </p>
          <p id="story">
            James didn't answer all he did was carefully took something out of
            his pocket placing the object around Genevive's necklace before
            whipering something in her ear. A smile appeared on Genevive's face
            as more tears streamed down her cheeks, as she nodded her head,
            smirking James took Genevive's hand before walking back to the
            window grabbing the black cored still dangling near the window.
            Turning to the enraged Castro and the shocked crowd James answer his
            question.
