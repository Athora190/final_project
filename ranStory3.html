      <p id="story">
        It all started when my sister died, its a day I can never forget. That
        night when my mother, father and I were sleeping, I heard voices coming
        from my sisters room. Being the curious child I was I went to
        investegate, when I got to my sister's door I heard her scream. When I
        opened it I will never forget what I saw, my sister dead on the floor
        drowning in her own blood.
      </p>

      <p id="story">
        That day I made it my lives purpose to solve any crime that comes my
        way, becoming a detective for the New York police deparment. My name is
        Lilith Johnson I will find my sister's killer and bring them to justice.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        I just finished working on a case when I was called to the cheif's
        office, walking in the cheif immediately went straight to the point.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "Lilith I know this is suddenly especially when you just finished
        working on a case but, I need you help on this one"
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "What case is it sir?" I asked
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "You might be too familar with this but, you are the best detective we
        have"
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        The cheif passed the case file to me, upon reading it my eyes widened at
        its contents. The suspect had the same mo as my sister's killer, a clean
        cut in the neck.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "Was is a copycat?" I asked
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "That was our first suggestion, but based on the crime scene there were
        too many similarities"
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        I sighed at the situation but, knowing that this was my only chance to
        catch him and advange my sister's death. And wasn't going to back away
        now, taking the chance I accepted the the case and began to work.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        Going back to the crime scene I was able find somethings that didn't
        belong their as if it was from a diiferent crime scene. Going back to
        the department I looked through some other crime files that were similar
        to the case im working on.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        Continuing to connect the dots my investegation lead me to a family
        friend and my best friend Max Callian. However, this visit wasn't that
        for a friendly matter.
      </p>
      <h2 id="chapter">Chapter 2</h2>
      <p id="story">
        While I was doing my investegation I found many things and one of them
        was my sister's necklace in other crime scene, where a co-worker of my
        sister's was also murdered the same way. And the both of them worked at
        the same place including the other victums.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        Walking into my friends office, I was greeted by my black haired, blue
        eyed friend sitting in his office smiling at me. However, when he saw
        the look on my face the his smile on his faded instantly.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "What brings you here Lilith?"
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "I think you know? Max, April 21st, 2009" I said getting to the point.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        Max's eyes widened for a moment before becoming normal. Playing it off
        as if he doesn't know eveything.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "don't do this Max, I know everything. What I don't know is why? Why did
        you kill her Max!? she trusted you and you killed her!"
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        Max sighed before standing up from his chair, with a defeated look on
        his face. As he expained his reasoning.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "I didn't want to kill her, not any of them. But I didn't have much of a
        choice."
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "You always have a choice, Max. Now I've made mine" I stated, as police
        officers came into Max's office arresting him.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        "You have no idea, who you're messing with Lilith."
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        I watched as the police officers took my friend away in cuffs. With the
        case closed I went back to my office at the police department, however,
        when I arrived I found an envelope on my desk. Opening it what I found
        shocked me.
      </p>
      <p id="story">
        It was a letter marked in red that said these words. 
        YOU ARE NEXT.
