          In the office of Lincoln Hill lies his son, Persues. Seating in his
          father chair, reading Lincoln's journal trying to find answers to what
          Persues' father searched for his entire life. The treasure of the
          greek Gods.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          After a few moments a knock came at the door. Persues looked up from
          his father's journal asking the person to come in.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Come in!" The person at the door reaviled to be Persues' friend Henry
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Hey, Henry long time no see. What brings you here?" Persues asked
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Guess what I found?" Henry started
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I found an exabition team who are investagating the Zeus' treasure.
          And they need an archaeologist. And I recomminded you"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Getting up Persues hugged his dear friend thanking Henry for granting
          him this opportunity. As Henry told Persues the details of the mission
          Persues began to pack some of his things and the next morning Persues
          was off to greece to begin his journey to find what his father had
          been searching for his entire life.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Persues meat his team in one of the most enchanting forests in greece
          setting up camp there. Upon meeting his team there were, two males
          including himself and one female. The name of the two males were Ethen
          and Jack. While female's name was Jenny.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Getting to know his team Persues found them to be perfessional enough
          for the long journey ahead of them. Persues and his team spent the
          whole day planning the routes they will be going through choosing the
          most safest and sometimes most riskest paths to get to their
          destination.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Early the next morning Persues and his team left on their mission to
          the the said spot of where Olympus would be standing. Along the way
          the team encountered many dangers they either expected or not expected
          at all, from slippery trails to climbing montains.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          During the voyage Persues felt like someone was watching him with
          every step he took. When Persues and his team finally reached there
          destination, what they found was not they anticipated.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          At the top of the mountain Persues and his team found Olympus however,
          that was not the only thing they saw. Going inside the Gods home the
          team were immeditaly separated after a beam of light came upon them.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Having been separtated the team experienced different trials based on
          their skills and minds, and the Greeks themselves charished both
          qualities. Persues' trial was, however, different from the rest. He
          was shown events of the past, expecually this one event where a man
          who look similar to him with his black hair and bluish-green eyes.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          The strange man was kneeling before Zeus himself, king of all Gods.
          The God gave the man something a round object covered in gold with the
          symbol of a lighting bolt in the center. Taking the object the man hid
          it in a secret chamber in the temple placing the item in their hands
          on a marbel pedestal that contained many other golden objects.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          When Persues finished his trial he was greeted by the same man. The
          Man spoke to Persues telling him of his duty.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Persues Hill, my descendant"

      <div id="chapter2">
        <p id="story">
          "Who are you?"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "My name is Aegeus"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "The protector" Persues pointed out, Aegeus nodded his head in
          responds
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I am the first and last of the guardians of this holy place, and I
          ask you; my descendent to continue our mission."
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "What mission?" Persues questioned
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "To protect the Gods treasure's from the hands of humanity"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "But you're human aren't you? Why protect something that was not meant
          for our kind?"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "We are not human, my descendant" At this Persues' widened at the
          words Aegeus spoke of.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I was made out of the earth of Olympus by Zeus, and so are you my
          descendent"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "But, you died"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "As the world changed, with humanity destorying the earth they live
          on, I also parish along with them, however, before my passing I
          bestowed my seed to a mortal women who cared for me." Aegeus continued
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "My legacy continued to do the work I could not do anymore, for as
          long as their is a guardian the Gods treasure can not be touched by
          mortal hands." Taking in Aegeus' story Persues began to question why
          are the treasure never allowed to reach human hands?
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Why can't humans get their hands on the treasures?"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Zeus knew something evil was coming to this realm, that is why Zeus
          ordered the Gods to bestow their power inside objects of holy value so
          they could be used against this evil." Aegeus began
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "However, Zeus knew he could not trust his creations with the task of
          keeping them safe as the hearts of humanity were being corrupted by
          this upcoming evil. Before returning to the clouds Zeus created me to
          guard the sacred objects blessed by the Gods from humanity or anyone
          other than the Gods themselves."
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          After Aegeus finished telling his lifes purpose, his eyes wondered
          around the temple walls as if sencing something was happening. Acting
          quickly he gave Persues a choice, to either follow his hearts desire
          or to do what he was always meant to do since he was born.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Now, Persues, my descendent. I have been watching over you as I have
          done to the others before you. I know where your heart lies, why you
          came to this holy ground. But, I'm afraid something has happened,
          before I leave. I give you a choice, Persues, you can follow your
          hearts desire to prove your father's search for this place or you can
          protect the blessed object hidden in this temple"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "But, you must knew whatever you choose will have consequences" before
          Persues could ask what does Aegeus meant by this he was gone in a
          blink of an eye.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Like Aegeus said Persues heard gun shots near by. Running to the sound
          he found himself in a murder scene, as he found three of his team
          members dead on the floor with Jenny the only one standing with the
          murder weapon in her hands, along with other men in black suits next
          to her they didn't seem normal as they had black vains showing on
          their skin.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          As soon as Persues stepped inside the area he was apprehended by the
          men in black dragged towards Jenny.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "What's the meaning of this Jenny?" Persues asked as Jenny pointed the
          gun at him.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "This is the end of an era Persues, so a new one can being" Putting
          the pieces together Persues figured out what was going on, this was
          what the evil Aegeus was talking about how it was corrupting humanity.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Its you isn't it. Your the evil thats been corrupting the world"
          Jenny smiled at Persues' discovery
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "So you've meat Aegeus, What did he show you?"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Persues said nothing as he glared at Jenny with his bluish-green eyes.
          For a second Jenny's eye widened as if she remembered something,
          before grinning from hear to hear.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I know those eyes, haha. You are a descendant of him aren't you
          Persues. Yes thats why you looked so familar to me"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "How do you know Aegeus?" Persues asked
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "We fought before centries ago, he defeated cursing me into this
          pathetic state so I couldn't touch the blessed objects. But, now I
          have you"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I will never help you!" Persues announced
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "You won't have a choice, I wasn't able to control Aegeus because he
          wasn't human. But, you Persues, are part human which means you have
          desires like everyone else."
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Suddenly Jenny grabbed Persues by his neck looking him in the eyes as
          Jenny's eyes turned completely black. Asking Persues what was his
          hearts desire? As Persues' eyes became glazed over.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "To prove my father's research of Olympus" smiling Jenny whispered
          empty promises to him before asking were was the secret crept.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Show me where the crept is Persues and you will have what you desire
          and show much more"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          The men in black let Persues go as he lead them to the crept, opening
          the secret door with his hand as was shown to him by his trial. Jenny
          looked around the crept seeing what she as always wanted for centries
          right in front of her eyes Zeus' lighting orb.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Take the orb Persues, and all you've ever wanted will be realized"
          Jenny said to him.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Following her command Persues walked towards the orb taking in his
          hands as he was walking back to Jenny, Aegeus came to him in his
          subconciousness. Pleading Persues to wake up.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Persues, wake up. Don't listen to the darkness, don't let it
          corrupted your heart. You will get nothing in return" when nothing was
          getting through to him, Aegeus tried again. Not giving up
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Persues, this is not what your father would have wanted." At those
          words Persues stopped walking, knowing it was Aegeus Jenny tried to
          persuade Persues' heart once more.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "What do you know what my father would have wanted?" Persues asked
          Aegeus in his subconcious.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "As I have told you before Persues, I have been watching over you ever
          since you were born. I saw the way father cared for you, loved you.
          Your father would never what you to hurt other at his expence no
          father would. He wanted you to keep your eyes open to the world around
          you not tarnish it with evil, you Persues are strong, fight the
          darkness that claims false promises to you. Follow your hearts desire
          as you wish it" Aegeus preached
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Make your desires your own, don't let someone else control it for
          you. This is was makes you a guardian, to protect humanities desires
          from those who wish to corrupt it. Use Zeus' orb to vanquish the evil"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Getting through to Persues, he was able to break free of Jenny's
          control. In Persues' hands Zeus' orb began to glow as Jenny tried to
          use her power to take Persues' heart by force. A lighting shield
          appeared surrounding Persues in a protective barrier, fear showed in
          Jenny's eyes as thunder clouds began cover the clear skies.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "You will never control another's heart again" Persues declared as
          lighting struck down on Jenny and her men turning them into dust.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I am not the only evil that lurks in this world there are other
          coming, you shall die guardian. Just like your father" Was Jenny last
          words as she turned to ash, blowing in the wind as the thunder clouds
          parted the skies making it clear once more.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Then I will defeat all of you, no matter what is takes"
