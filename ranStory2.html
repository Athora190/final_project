        <p id="story">
          One sunny day, in the evening in New York city a man by the name of
          Peter Zaki is walking out of the courthouse to his car, finishing a
          days work talking to his wife, Hannah on the phone.
        </p>

        <p id="story">
          "So hows my little man?" Peter asked about his son
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Henry is fine Peter, so what do you want for dinner?"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "hmm I don't know surprise me"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Suddenly as Peter was about to open the driver side door of his car, a
          load bang echoed to area a range of banging followed soon after.
          Acting quickly Peter ducked for cover moving to the passenger side as
          it was on the sidewalk. As the people in the area did the same running
          for their lives.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Peter! Are you okay!? Were thoes gun shots!?" Hannah said on the
          phone in a panic hearing what happened.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Don't worry Hannah I'm okay," Peter's wife sighed in relief however,
          it was short lived.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          As seconds later the sound of the front door being knocked down was
          heard over the phone. soon after that the sounds of a struggle as
          Hannah's voice could be heard yelling at her son to call the police
          moments before her phone was taken from her.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Hannah? Hannah!? what going on?" Peter questioned in a panic worried
          for his family.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          A few agonizing seconds later someone asnwered however, it was not
          Peter's wife but someone extremely dangerous.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Hello Peter" a deep male voice answered the phone instead of Hannah.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Who the hell are you!? where's my wife?" Peter said fearing the
          saftey of his wife and their only son, Henry.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Now now Peter, don't be like that. Your wife and son are fine as long
          as you hand back what the money you stole from me"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "What money?" Peter asked confused
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Oh Peter, don't play dumb. It wasn't easy tracking you down, but the
          least you could do is be honest"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I won't ask again, what money?" On the other end the male chuckled at
          Peter's change of attitude.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "My my showing your true self are you now... Bounty Hunter"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Who are you?" Peter asked.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "You may have heard of me, I am Gilian"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Peter's eyes widened at the name as it only belonged to one of my
          powerful and well known mafia in New York. The northern mafia and
          Gilian was then name of their leader.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "What you want?"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I already said want I wanted, Peter. I want my money back"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Well I don't have it, look somewhere else" Peter stated
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I beg to differ, I have surveiliance evidence telling me other wise,
          but because you seem like a man who keeps his word. I'll trust you"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Then leave me and my family alone"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Nah ah ah, Peter. I trust you to find the real culprit, you have the
          skills to do so don't you?" Peter stayed silent as he couldn't do
          anything else.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Once you return my money I will let your family go, and you won't
          have to hear from me again. Do we have a deal?"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Peter knew to never make a deal with the devil however, in this case
          with his family on the line he had now other choice. With a sigh
          feeling helpless for the first time in his life he agreed to the deal.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Good choice Peter, we will meet tomorrow morning. Don't be late" Was
          the last thing the mafia leader said before hanging up the phone.

      <h2 id="chapter">Chapter 2</h2>
      <div id="chapter2">
        <p id="story">
          The next day Peter watched the surveiliance camera's of the day the
          northern's money was stolen. Upon seeing the video he immediately
          found some clues on the real culprit not many but, enough. Getting to
          work, Peter went to the mafia's money vault find a napkin of a bar a
          few blocks way from the hidden vault.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Contiuing to following what the culptrint's footsteps, Peter ended up
          in the southern part of New York, lower manhatten. As Peter was
          following the culprit in his car, he was suddenly rammed from behind
          causing him to lose control of his car for a few seconds.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Gaining control Peter look through his rearview mirror to see a black
          car tailing behind him. Acting quickly Peter made evasive menuevers,
          having bullets fly passed him through the rear window of his car.
          Losing the black vehicle in an intersection, Peter however, also lost
          his trail on the culprit as well.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Thinking all hope was lost Peter almost broken down in tears however,
          right across the street from his car Peter saw a familar symbol on the
          door of a closed resturant he found on teh napkin at the vault.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Who would close a resturant doing lunch time?" Peter said to himself
          as he stepped out of his car to check it out.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Going inside Peter looked around the empty resturant only see that it
          looked pretty normal, however, going to the back of the building he
          found the same symbol as on the front door on a door in the kitchen.
          Taking out his phone Peter dialed Gilian putting the call on speaker
          as he opened the symboled door.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Stepping inside the place was completely different them on the other
          side with lavish furniture and suculint plants, giving a the place a
          high class vibe looking at it. Scanning the area Peter saw a familar
          silhouette walking down the hall turning the corner.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Chasing after the figure in desperation, Peter found himself in front
          of someone's office. Opening the door Peter found himself at gun point
          with five man point a gun at him while a lone male with brown hair and
          eyes look upon Peter's helpless state with a grin and the culprit next
          to him reviling themselves to be a women with black hair and brown
          eyes with the same smug look on her face.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Well Well, look what we have hear boys" the brunette gloated
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "It seems the rat found its bait" Peter raised his hands unable to
          defend himself. However, Peter wore an expression of victory as he
          knew exactually what he was doing.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          The brunette narrowed their eyes suspision on Peter's appearence as it
          was not the look he expected of the well know bounty hunter to make.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Is that what you think? Victor" Gilian said on the phone in Peter's
          hands.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          Victor's eyes widened hearing Gilian's voice on the phone, knowing
          that all he had worked for was lost the second Peter walked in. Peter
          lowered his arms knowing that is was all over of Victor.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "G Gilian, what an unexpected surprise to hear from you" Victory
          stuttered
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Yes, it is. I see you've meet Peter, he's currently helping me find
          someone for me"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "O oh, and who might that be?"
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "The B*tch next to you" Gilian answer in a dark tone.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          The second Gilian said those words the glass behind Victor broke as
          the women next to him fell forward on the floor before her blood began
          to spread across the grond as a whole could be found on the back of
          her head. This put everyone in the room on edge as they were on alert
          looking around the room for anything that could lead to Gilian's
          appearence.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "Now lets get to business Victor. Where is the money you stole from
          me?" Gilian continued as Victor, having no other choice gave what he
          had stolen back to its rightful owner.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          However, Gilian was never the type to forgive and forget so, there was
          a punishment for Victor's actions which know one wanted to experience.
          As for Peter he return to Gilian to finish off their deal, getting his
          family back safetly. Going through with the deal they made Gilian
          returned Peter's family to him safe and sound.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "You know Peter, you could always work for me." Gilian purposed as
          Peter was leaving his office.
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "I don't think so, my job is already dangerous enough. I don't need to
          put my family in more harms way then they already are."
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "So you haven't told them have you" Gilian concluded
        </p>
        <p id="story">
          "And never plan to" was the only thing Peter said before leaving
          Gilian's office.
