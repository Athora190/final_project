      <p id="story">
        One sunny day, in the evening in New York city a man by the name of
        Peter Zaki is walking out of the courthouse to his car, finishing a days
        work talking to his wife, Hannah on the phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        "So hows my little man?" Peter asked about his son
      </p>
      <p>
        "Henry is fine Peter, so what do you want for dinner?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "hmm I don't know surprise me"
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly as Peter was about to open the driver side door of his car, a
        load bang echoed to area a range of banging followed soon after. Acting
        quickly Peter ducked for cover moving to the passenger side as it was on
        the sidewalk. As the people in the area did the same running for their
        lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Peter! Are you okay!? Were thoes gun shots!?" Hannah said on the phone
        in a panic hearing what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry Hannah I'm okay," Peter's wife sighed in relief however, it
        was short lived.
      </p>
      <p>
        As seconds later the sound of the front door being knocked down was
        heard over the phone. soon after that the sounds of a struggle as
        Hannah's voice could be heard yelling at her son to call the police
        moments before her phone was taken from her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hannah? Hannah!? what going on?" Peter questioned in a panic worried
        for his family.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few agonizing seconds later someone asnwered however, it was not
        Peter's wife but someone extremely dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hello Peter" a deep male voice answered the phone instead of Hannah.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who the hell are you!? where's my wife?" Peter said fearing the saftey
        of his wife and their only son, Henry.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now now Peter, don't be like that. Your wife and son are fine as long
        as you hand back what the money you stole from me"
      </p>
      <p>
        "What money?" Peter asked confused
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh Peter, don't play dumb. It wasn't easy tracking you down, but the
        least you could do is be honest"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I won't ask again, what money?" On the other end the male chuckled at
        Peter's change of attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        "My my showing your true self are you now... Bounty Hunter"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who are you?" Peter asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You may have heard of me, I am Gilian"
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter's eyes widened at the name as it only belonged to one of my
        powerful and well known mafia in New York. The northern mafia and Gilian
        was then name of their leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What you want?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I already said want I wanted, Peter. I want my money back"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well I don't have it, look somewhere else" Peter stated
      </p>
      <p>
        "I beg to differ, I have surveiliance evidence telling me other wise,
        but because you seem like a man who keeps his word. I'll trust you"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Then leave me and my family alone"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Nah ah ah, Peter. I trust you to find the real culprit, you have the
        skills to do so don't you?" Peter stayed silent as he couldn't do
        anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Once you return my money I will let your family go, and you won't have
        to hear from me again. Do we have a deal?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter knew to never make a deal with the devil however, in this case
        with his family on the line he had now other choice. With a sigh feeling
        helpless for the first time in his life he agreed to the deal.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Good choice Peter, we will meet tomorrow morning. Don't be late" Was
        the last thing the mafia leader said before hanging up the phone.
      </p>
      <h2 id="chapter">Chapter 2</h2>
      <p id="story">
        The next day Peter watched the surveiliance camera's of the day the
        northern's money was stolen. Upon seeing the video he immediately found
        some clues on the real culprit not many but, enough. Getting to work,
        Peter went to the mafia's money vault find a napkin of a bar a few
        blocks way from the hidden vault.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contiuing to following what the culptrint's footsteps, Peter ended up in
        the southern part of New York, lower manhatten. As Peter was following
        the culprit in his car, he was suddenly rammed from behind causing him
        to lose control of his car for a few seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaining control Peter look through his rearview mirror to see a black
        car tailing behind him. Acting quickly Peter made evasive menuevers,
        having bullets fly passed him through the rear window of his car. Losing
        the black vehicle in an intersection, Peter however, also lost his trail
        on the culprit as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking all hope was lost Peter almost broken down in tears however,
        right across the street from his car Peter saw a familar symbol on the
        door of a closed resturant.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who would close a resturant doing lunch time?" Peter said to himself as
        he stepped out of his car to check it out.
